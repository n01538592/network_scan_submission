# network_scan_submission

This repository contains the files for my Cyber Security Internship task:
- Localhost port scan
- Local network hosts scan
- Router port scan

## Files
- `localhost_scan.txt` → Scan results of my PC
- `local_network_hosts.txt` → Scan results of all devices in local network
- `router_ports.txt` → Scan results of router ports
- `Network_Scan_Report.docx` (optional) → Word report with tables, screenshots, and observations

## Notes
- All scans were done using Nmap on Windows
- Only standard ports are open; no high-risk exposure detected
